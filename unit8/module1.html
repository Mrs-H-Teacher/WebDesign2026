<h1>Module 1: Client Website</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This unit is the culminating project of this curriculum, in which students work with actual clients in the community to develop a quality website. There is only one module in this unit, comprised of three lessons (plus one final Reflections module). Each lesson in the current module is described below. A more extensive overview, including possible problems you might encounter related to students working with clients, is provided on the <a href="index.html">Instructor's Unit 8 home page</a>.</p>

<h2>Lesson 1: Planning the Client Website </h2>
  
<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Completion times vary significantly.</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit8/module1/lesson1.html">Link to student Lesson 1 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
 <li>The most challenging aspect of this unit is to match students with clients. The ideal client is a community member whose organization or business needs a website. Often the students are able to think of a family member or friend who needs a site.</li>
 <li>Provided your school or district is agreeable, the next best client is one from your own school, such as an academic department, club, or sports team.</li>
 <li>If neither of these options is available, then the instructor can play the role of client, representing a fictitious organization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resources Needed</h3> 
	<ul>
  	<li>Blank copies of the Market Analysis worksheet. This worksheet is designed to be printed and completed by hand during client interviews. However, Word and plain ASCII text versions are additionally avaialable for students who require alternate format. Students can enter their responses directly into the form using these alternative versions. The following are links to the three versions of the Market Analysis worksheet:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../../student/unit8/module1/MarketAnalysis.pdf">PDF version</a> (requires <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>)</li>
			<li><a href="../../student/unit8/module1/MarketAnalysis.doc">Word version</a> (requires <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857991033.aspx">Microsoft Word</a>)</li>
			<li><a href="../../student/unit8/module1/MarketAnalysis.txt">Plain text version</a></li>
		</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggested Assessment</h3>
<p>Collect students' Market Analysis worksheets to see that they have thoughtfully planned the project. Check to see if they have a clear understanding of the client's purpose for a website. The sketch of the home page should appear to be a layout that is reasonable for a first year student to accomplish.</p>

<h2>Lesson 2: Constructing the Client Website </h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Completion times vary significantly.</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit8/module1/lesson2.html">Link to student Lesson 2 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Throughout the student development of the client website try to emphasize to the student the importance of maintaining communication with both you (the instructor) and the client. A consistent email reporting requirement (weekly or biweekly) is strongly recommended. </li>
 <li>Especially when community clients are concerned, be vigilant regarding the safety of students. Whenever reasonable have students arrange to meet with their client on campus during class time. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggested Assessment</h3>
<p>Monitor students communication and check progress on an ongoing basis.</p>

<h2>Lesson 3: Quality Control of the Client Website </h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Completion times vary significantly.</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit8/module1/lesson3.html">Link to student Lesson 3 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We recommend requiring students to print their initial validation reports so that you can use them as a check list to ensure corrections were made.</li>
  <li>A final assessment of students' websites can take place in a conference with the instructor. Strengths of the website, as well as areas needing improvement, can be discussed. The assessment should be based at least in part on the students' own <a href="../../student/unit8/module1/lesson2.html">website evaluation tool</a> that was initially created in Unit 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Handout/Resources Needed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Student generated web evaluation tool (Unit 1, Module 1)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggested Assessment</h3>
<p>For a summative evaluation apply the student generated web evaluation tool (Unit 1, Module 1).</p>
