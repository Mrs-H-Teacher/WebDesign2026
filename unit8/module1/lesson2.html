<h1>Lesson 2: Constructing the Client Website</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This lesson page provides some advice concerning the construction of a website for a client. The only activities in this lesson are to read this page, then to apply what you've learned in this course and start coding!</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>To construct a high quality, usable and accessible website that meets and supports the client's purpose.</p>

<h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>demonstrate mastery of website construction techniques by following the full design and development process from beginning to end.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Advice</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>After you have reviewed your plans with your instructor, make arrangements with your instructor to met with the client and share your plans. Record any changes the client requests.</li>
  <li>Don't be defensive with the client. Remember: the site is for the client not you.  </li>
  <li>Focus first on content, second on presentation of that content.</li>
  <li>Code the content in simple HTML with little or no formatting.</li>
  <li>Order the page elements in a logical order and contain all the elements in tags that reflect the nature and structure of the content. For example, use <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> for the main heading, <strong>&lt;h2&gt;</strong> for subheadings, and <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> tags for most other text content.</li>
  <li>Setup an external style sheet and apply formatting and layout to make the site presentable.</li>
  <li>Check in frequently with your instructor</li>
  <li>Communicate regularly with the client.</li>
  <li>Review the site evaluation tool that was developed by the class. Has your site met those standards?</li>
  <li>Validate your site's HTML and CSS, and evaluate it for accessibility.</li>
 </ul>
<h2>All done? </h2>
<p>Carefully review your client website with your instructor using the evaluation tool
  the class created in Unit 1 and a printed copy of your validation report. Then proceed to the <a href="lesson3.html">next lesson</a>.</p>
