<h1>Lesson 1: Reflections</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This module consists of a single activity that gives you an opportunity to reflect upon and summarize what you learned in Unit 8 as you developed a website for a client. Since this is your last activity, it's also an opportunity to reflect upon and summarize what you learned in the course as a whole, and to put any final touches on your portfolio.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Using your text editor, open the <span class="filename">index.html</span> file of your web portfolio.</li>
	<li>Beneath the <span class="filename">Unit 8</span> sub-heading, replace the placeholder content with a summary of what you learned in Unit 8 as you developed a website for a client. Your summary should include one ore more paragraphs of text (using the <span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span> element), plus a list of things you found particularly informative about this unit (using either a <span class="element">&lt;ul&gt;</span> or <span class="element">&lt;ol&gt;</span> element)</li>
	<li>When finished, consider whether you feel your web portfolio is complete. Does it capture everything you learned in this course? Does it contain all the content you would like? Is it stylized in a way that is an accurate reflection of your skill and style? Would you be comfortable sharing it with a potential client or employer? Use the skills you've learned in this course to tweak your portfolio until you're satisfied that is an accurate reflection of you as a web developer and designer.</li> 	
</ol>

<h2>All done?</h2>
<p class="alert">Congratulations! You have completed the Web Design &amp; Development I course curriculum!</p>
