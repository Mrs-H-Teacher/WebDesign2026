<h1>Module 2: Reflections</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This module consists of a single activity that gives students an opportunity to reflect upon and summarize what they learned by creating a real world website. This is also the final activity of the curriculum, so students should be encouraged to reflect on the entire course. 
	</p>

<h2>Lesson 1: Reflections</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 30 - 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit2/module6/">Link to student Lesson 1 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>As with the previous <em>Reflections</em> activities, this activity can be extended to include reflections that are posted to a blog for the entire class. Students can benefit by seeing the successes and struggles other students have encountered in the unit, and in the course as a whole.</li>
	<li>As noted in the <em>Overview</em> section above, this is the final activity of the curriculum, so students should be encouraged to reflect on the entire course. What do they think of web design and development? Are they interested in learning more? Might it play some role in their future as they consider possible careers?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Output</h3>
  <p>When this lesson is complete, students will have added final <em>Reflections</em> content to their <a href="../examples/unit8/module2/lesson1/index.html">index.html</a> file. <strong>Student portfolios are now complete!</strong></p>
