<h1>Unit 8: Client Website</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Unit 8, students create a website for an actual client. This is intended to be a capstone project that requires students to synthesize all the skills learned in this curriculum. By this point they should be able to develop a simple web site that is highly accessible, standards compliant, and thoughtfully designed. Creating the site for an actual client is in our belief the best learning experience imaginable. When given an authentic purpose and audience, students tend to take the task more seriously, partly because the stakes are higher. Under these circumstances, students are motivated by more than just a grade; they have the satisfaction of seeing their work published and they are also motivated by  a commitment or an informal contract they enter with the client to produce a site.</p>
<p>That said, creating a site for an actual client introduces several practical challenges that will need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some students may be unable to locate a client, and will either need assistance or an alternative assignment.</li>
	<li>Some students may need assistance communicating with clients if they have not yet learned crucial "soft skills."</li>
	<li>Some clients may agree to participate, but ultimately are too busy to work with students.</li>
	<li>Client expectations may not be in line with students' skill sets</li> 
  <li>Publishing student work and or identifiable information about students on the Internet might conflict with school or district policies.</li>
  <li>Your school or district might have policies or protocols affecting student contact with community members.</li>
  <li>Your school or district might have policies regarding the use of district equipment (e.g., computers and software) when profit is involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>When students do not have enough time to start a client site, or one or more of the above obstacles is insurmountable, an alternative is to have students develop a web site for a fictitious client. When doing so, they should still use the same process as laid out in this unit, which echos the process taught throughout the course. Also, think creatively about strategies for making the client seem authentic and real.</p> 

<p>You might consider creating a certificate that acknowledges successful completion of the course to award students at the end.</p>

<p>Students can potentially earn college credit if there is a college in your vicinity that is willing to undergo the articulation process. The co-authors of this curriculum reached an agreement with three community colleges in our area to provide 5 college credits for students that complete two semesters of our curriculum and receive a B grade or better for each semester.</p>

<p class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 6 to 20+ hours. Completion time varies greatly.</p>

<h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>The student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>plan the design and development of a website with appropriate level of detail and complexity.</li>
	<li>develop a plan with the level of detail and sophistication appropriate to purpose and audience.</li>
	<li>identify areas in which web authoring software can assist in this process.</li>
	<li>demonstrate mastery of website construction techniques by following the full design and development process from beginning to end.</li>
	<li>perform a complete set of <em>quality control</em> tests to find and correct problems in their website before declaring it &quot;finished&quot;.</li>
</ul>
