<h1>Lesson 1: Selection Tools</h1>


  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p> In this lesson, you will be introduced to the various selection tools that 
    are common in many graphics programs. You will then use each of these tools 
    to cut out various objects from their backgrounds. Finally, you will learn 
    how to feather the edges of a selection to create a more gentle looking edge.</p>
  <h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
  <p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>utilize the basic marquee and other selection tools to cut out objects 
      or isolate them from their backgrounds.</li>
    <li>feather the edges of a selection.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Activities</h2>
  
  <h3>Part 1: &nbsp;Selecting Images</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First, read <a href="selection_tools.html">Selection Tools</a> to get an 
      overview of different selection tools common in graphics programs. Your 
      instructor will demonstrate how to use the selection tools in the software 
      application being used.</li>
   <li>Then, open up the image <a href="../pix/selection_practice.jpg">selection_practice.jpg</a> 
      and, following the direction in <a href="selection_tools.html">Selection 
      Tools</a>,
use the different tools to extract the objects from their backgrounds.
&nbsp;Practice different techniques for extracting the images.</li> 
      <li>Once you are comfortable extracting the images, create a new file in your software and set the size to 600 x 200.<br></li>
      <li>Keep the selection practice image open and select the image 1 using the oval
marquee tool. &nbsp;Once
you have made your selection, copy the selection and then go to the new
image you created, create a new layer and paste your selection. Repeat
this for each of the selection practice images. &nbsp;When you are
done, you should have a cutout of each of the
objects on their own layer. You will use these images in the next
lesson to design a practice banner.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Resources/Online Documents</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="selection_tools.html">Selection Tools</a></li>
    <li>Practice image: <a href="../pix/selection_practice.jpg">selection_practice.jpg</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>All done?</h2>
  <p>Save the project file with the cutout images now in separate 
layers, to your <em>images</em> subfolder. This file  
    will be used again in <a href="lesson2.html">the next lesson</a>.</p>
