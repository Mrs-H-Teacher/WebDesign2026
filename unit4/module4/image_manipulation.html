<h1>Basic Image Manipulation</h1>



  <h2>Pointer Tool</h2>
  <p>The pointer tool <img src="../pix/pointer_tool.gif" alt="pointer 
tool" width="25" height="25" /> 
    is the basic tool used to select graphic objects and move them. To move an 
    object, select the pointer tool, select the object, make sure you are on the 
    right layer, and then simply click and drag.</p>
  <h2>Copy and Paste </h2>
  <p>The same as in word processing programs, copy and paste can be used to duplicate 
    or cut out objects. First select the object tool that you want to copy 
    using the pointer tool or selection. Then select <em>cut</em> or <em>copy</em> from the main menu (or use keyboard shortcuts, for example CTRL-x for cut and CTRL-C for 
    copy in Windows; Command-x for cut and Command-c for copy in Mac OS X). You can then paste the object to the same layer, a different layer, 
    or even a different project.</p>
  <h2>Scale</h2>
  <p>The scale function allows you to change the dimensions of an object, making 
    it smaller or larger. Drag the corners to make the object larger or smaller 
    while maintaining the same aspect ratio or drag the sides to elongate the 
    object&#8217;s height or width.</p>
  <h2>Transform</h2>
  <p>The transform function allows you to resize an object, just as the scale 
    tool does, but also lets you rotate the object as well. To rotate the object, 
    move the mouse pointer just outside of the image until you see the rotate 
    symbol. Then press down on the left mouse button and drag to rotate. The example 
    below shows an object being rotated using the transform tool.<br />
</p>

rotating with the transform tool" width="594" height="191" /></p>
  <h2>Skew and Distort</h2>
  <p>These tools allow you to stretch, squeeze and tilt the image by manipulating 
    its four corner vertices. Skew moves the top and bottom vertices in unison, 
    while distort lets you move each of the vertices independently. The skew and 
    distort functions are good for creating three dimensional effects or illusions 
    of depth in images.</p>

  <p>Below is an example of using the <strong>skew</strong> tool:</p>
