<h1>Lesson 2: Layer Effects and Blending</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> In this lesson, you will learn about layer effects such as
drop shadow, glow, and bevel and emboss. You will also learn how to
adjust the opacity of an image or layer, and will apply layer blending
properties. The images you created from <a href="lesson1.html">Lesson
1</a> will be used to create a practice collage-style web banner.
</p>
<p>The final project for this module will be to create a
personalized web banner for your web portfolio. You will add this image
to the top of each of your portfolio web pages.</p>

<h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>apply layer effects such as drop shadow, glow, and bevel and emboss.</li>
	<li>adjust the opacity of a layer or object.</li>
	<li>adjust blending properties to create more advanced blending effects.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<h3>Part 1: &nbsp;Practice Collage</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, read <a href="image_manipulation.html">Basic
Image Manipulation</a>, to learn about some of the basic ways to
manipulate images in your graphics program.</li>
<li>Next, read <a href="effects_blending.html">Layer
Effects and Blending</a>, to develop an understanding of how the
concept of layers effects work. Then, the instructor will demonstrate
how to apply layer effects, adjust opacity and adjust blending
properties in the particular software product being used by the class.</li>
<li>Open the file that you created in <a href="lesson1.html">lesson 1</a>
(the file with the many layers of images).</li>
<li>Use the images from the selection practice and manipulate
them to
create a collage. &nbsp;Try using some of the basic image
manipulation
techniques to resize the images. &nbsp;Adjust the layer order to
change
the way the images move to the front and which are positioned to the
back. &nbsp;Play with layer effects such as opacity to blend the
images
together. &nbsp;This is just
a practice activity so have fun with it and don't be afraid to try
different ideas. In the next activity, you will use your own images to
create a banner that will be used for your portfolio. &nbsp;The
image
below is one example of a collage made from the selection practice
images.

</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Create a Web Banner</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now that you've had some practice combining images in your practice collage, it's time to create a web banner for your class portfolio. In Unit 3 you learned about <a href="../../unit3/module6/lesson1.html">page layout with CSS</a>. In that lesson, you applied a hybrid fixed/fluid layout to your page with a minimum width of 720 pixels. You did that because you knew in a future lesson you would be creating a banner image that is 720 pixels wide. Well, that future lesson has arrived! Create a banner that is 720 pixels wide. Your banner's height is up to you, but keep in mind that if a banner is too tall, some users will have to scroll down to see the main content, and some users won't do that. Also, the larger an image is, the longer it takes to download, so it's important to use graphics efficiently. That said, it's also important for you to have plenty of canvas on which to practice your graphics skills, so try to find a balance between all these competing needs. You can always resize your image later if your initial height proves to be too short or too tall.    
</li>   
<li>Once your banner image is completed, save it to your <em>images</em> subfolder.</li>
<li>Now, add the banner image to the home page (<span class="filename">index.html</span>) of your portfolio using an  &lt;img&gt; element. In order to be visible on the web page, recall that the image needs to be inside the &lt;body&gt; element. Depending on your design, it might look best either immediately above or immediately below the main <span class="element">&lt;H1&gt;</span> heading. Try it in both locations, and see which location you like best.</li>  
<li>Remember to include an <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute containing alternate text (a short description) for people who are unable to see the banner.</li>
<li>After you've placed the banner in a location that you like on your site's home page and are satisfied with the results, use the same code to add the banner to the top of all other pages on your site.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All done?</h2>
<p>Make sure that you have inserted your portfolio banner onto your portfolio pages so that your instructor can check your work. When finished, proceed to the <a href="lesson3.html">next lesson</a>.</p>
