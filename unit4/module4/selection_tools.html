<h1>Selection Tools</h1>



  <h2>Basic Marquee</h2>
  <p>The marquee tool is the basic tool that allows you to select all or part 
    of objects. The marquee tool will generally have the option to select either 
    an oval or a square shape as the selection tool, but some programs offer more 
    choices. </p>
  <p>To select an area, simply click and drag the marquee around the area you 
    want to select. Most graphics programs allow you to draw a perfect circle 
    or perfect square by holding the shift key when you drag. Another common keyboard 
    shortcut is to hold down the space bar while you drag to reposition the location 
    of the marquee.</p>
  <p> The selected area will be identified by the “marching ants” 
    surrounding it (moving dashed lines). After your selection has been made, 
    the marquee allows you to manipulate the selection in a number of ways. Among 
    these are:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>copy and paste the selection</li>
    <li>apply filters and effects to only the selected area</li>
    <li>add fills using the paint bucket tool</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Lasso Tools</h2>
  <p>The lasso tool is another selection tool that allows more fine control over 
    the selection area than the basic oval and square marquee shapes. By clicking 
    down and dragging, the lasso tool allows you by freehand to draw the selection 
    line.</p>
  <p> Many programs offer different types of lasso tools that can be used to make 
    selections. The polygon lasso tool allows you to create a selection by clicking 
    on individual points that connect to create a selection line. </p>
  <h2>Magic Wand</h2>
  <p> The magic wand tool is used to select pixels that are the same color or 
    similar color in an adjacent area. You can adjust the tolerance level of the 
    magic wand tool to determine how similar the colors have to be. A low tolerance 
    means the pixels have to be nearly the same color, while a higher tolerance 
    allows for more variation. The magic wand tool is good for selecting objects 
    from against a solid color background.</p>
  <h2>Other Selection Tips</h2>
  <p>To fine tune your selections, there are some keyboard shortcuts that are 
    fairly standard amongst graphics programs. Holding down the shift key while 
    using one of the selection tools will add to an existing selection. Holding 
    down the alt key while using one of the selection tools will subtract from 
    the selection. Try using a combination of different selection tools along 
    with the shift and alt keys in order to fine tune your selection further. 
    After some practice, you will develop some techniques that work best for you.</p>
  <h2>Feathering a Selection</h2>
  <p>You can feather a selection to soften the edges of a selected object. Often, 
    when using the selection tools to create a cutout of an object, the edges 
    will be slightly rough and jagged. This causes the cutout to appear unnatural 
    and not blend in well with other elements in the graphic. Feathering can be 
    used to help smooth the edges of a cutout object, giving the edges a softer 
    look.</p>
  
  <p>Another use for feathering is to create a vignette effect. A vignette effect 
    is where the border of an image is feathered so that the edges of the images 
    seem to fade into the background.</p>
  
  <p>When feathering a selection, there are usually two options in most graphics 
    program. The first option is to set the feathering property for the selection 
    tool itself before you make the selection. The second option is to adjust 
    feathering for a selection that has already been made by using the feather 
    option, usually found under the selection menu.</p>
  <h2>Inverse Selection</h2>
  <p>The inverse selection tool lets you flip a selection so that the object you 
    selected is no longer selected, but everything else on the page now is. This 
    is especially helpful for use with the magic wand tool. The magic wand tool 
    is useful for selecting objects against a solid background. Instead of selecting 
    the object itself, though, it is easier to select the background. Then you 
    can use the inverse selection function to select the object. </p>
  <p>Inverse selection is usually found under the selection menu of the graphics 
    program. </p>
  <h2>Eraser Tool</h2>
  <p>Despite your most diligent efforts to make a perfect selection, it is inevitable 
    that you will run into situations where the cutout still has artifacts from 
    the background you were trying to remove. The eraser tool is helpful to help 
    remove these small pieces. A good trick is to zoom way in on the area you 
    are erasing so that you can see the individual pixels. Some graphic programs 
    allow you to set a feathered edge to the eraser tool. This is useful to help 
    touch up and soften the edges of a cutout.</p>
  <h2>Exercises</h2>
  <p>Open up the file <a href="../pix/selection_practice.jpg">selection_practice.jpg</a> 
    in your graphics software. You will then use the various selection tools to 
    extract each of the images from their backgrounds. Once you have made your 
    selection, copy and paste the image onto its own separate layer. Experiment 
    with using feathering and the eraser tool to help smooth the edges of your 
    selections. </p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Oval Marquee<br>
      </em>Practice using the oval marquee tool to select picture 1 of the earth. 
      It will be helpful to use the space key to reposition the selection as you 
    are dragging it.</li>
    <li><em>Lasso Tools</em><br>
      For images 2, 3 and 4, practice using the lasso tools to extract them from 
      their backgrounds. For image 3, remove the sky from the image. Experiment 
      with the different lasso tools available to you such as the polygon lasso 
      tool, or in some programs the magnetic lasso tool. Different people often 
      prefer different tools, so try each one to find out which you like best. 
    Remember to use the SHIFT and ALT keys to add and subtract from your selection.</li>
    <li><em>Magic Wand Tool</em><br>
      For images 4, 5 and 6, practice using the magic wand tool to extract them 
      from their backgrounds. One quick tip, though. It will be easiest to use 
      the magic wand tool if you first use the rectangular marquee tool to quickly 
      select the entire object and paste it into a new layer. Then use the magic 
      wand tool to select the background. Once the background is selected, hit 
      delete to remove the white color. To select the object, use the magic wand 
      tool to select the background once more. Once you have the background selected, 
      use the select inverse function from the selection menu. The object will 
    now be selected.</li>
    <li><em>Feathering</em><br>For
image 7, try using one of the lasso tools to select the car from its
background. &nbsp;Before you make the selection, though,set the
feathering value for the selection tool. &nbsp;The higher the value you
use, the more the edges of the selection will be faded. &nbsp; Once you
have the car selected and the feathering value set, choose
Select&gt;Inverse selection from the top menu amd hit delete.
&nbsp;This should delete everything except for the car from the image. </li>
  </ol>
