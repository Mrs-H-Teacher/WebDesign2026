<h1>Lesson 3: Cropping and Resizing</h1>


  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this lesson you will learn how to use the crop and resize functions of 
    a graphic editing program to size and frame an image so that it fits specific 
    dimensions needed to place it on a web page. You will crop and resize the 
    images you acquired in <a href="lesson2.html">the previous lesson</a> and then optimize the images for saving 
    in the jpeg format.</p>
  <h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
  <p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use the concepts of pixels and resolution to appropriately size images 
      for web pages</li>
    <li>understand how file size and bandwidth limitations influence the use of 
      web graphics</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Activities</h2>

  <h4>Practice resizing an image</h4>
  <p>Before you can use your images on your web page, 
      you must first resize them to the exact number of pixels 
      in which they will appear on the page.</p>
  <ol>
     <li>Read the introduction to resizing images in the online document <a href="http://www.digicamhelp.com/processing-photos/basic-editing/resizing/">
      Resizing a Digital Image</a>. While different graphics software may function slightly differently, 
      nearly all of the applications will let you resize images in a similar manner. 
     </li>
    <li>Before creating a final image, 
      practice with your graphics software: 
      Try resizing one of the images to create a 450 pixel wide viewable image.
    </li>
     <li>Now try again, but this time resize the image 
      to a 72 pixel wide thumbnail image (most screens display 72 pixels per inch).</li>
</ol>

 <h4>Practice cropping an image</h4>
   <p>While the resize image function is a useful function, sometimes you will 
      want more control over how the size of the image is reduced. The crop function 
      allows you to cut out a portion of the image or change the image dimensions 
      without distorting the image. </p>
   <ol>
     <li>Read the introduction to cropping images 
      in the online document <a href="http://www.caddpower.com/cms/croppingpictellsstory.htm">Cropping
       Photos: Every Picture Tells a Story</a>.</li>
     <li>Using the same original image from the previous activity, use the crop function along with the resize function to create a thumbnail image 
      that is 72 x 72 pixels in size and a viewable image that is 450 x 450 pixels 
      in size. Experiment with cropping the image in different ways to create 
      a different look.</li>
   </ol>

  <h4>Pratice saving/exporting an image</h4>
     <p>Now that you have cropped and resized your image, it is time to save 
      it in a suitable web format. Some graphics applications use the term <em>export</em>
      to refer to saving to files in any format other than the one primary format supported 
      by that application. In this lesson, these terms mean the same thing.  
     </p>
      <p>Remember from <a href="lesson1.html">Lesson 1</a>
      that images with gradations 
      in color or many different colors, such as photographs, are best saved in 
      jpeg format. In this activity, you will learn about how to optimize a jpeg 
      image and then save your cropped and resized image file as a jpeg.</p>

    <ol>
     <li>Read the sections on &quot;Image Formats&quot; and &quot;JPG and PNG Basics&quot; in WebMonkey's <a 
href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/Site_Optimization_Tutorial_-_Lesson_1">Site Optimization Tutorial</a>. 
      </li>
     <li>Save the image you cropped and resized in the previous 
      activity as a jpeg. Experiment with different quality settings and then 
      observe the resulting file sizes and image quality. Try and determine what 
      compression setting will achieve the lowest file size while still producing 
      an image of adequate quality.</li>
    </ol>

   <h4>The Real Thing: Cropping, Resizing, and Saving</h4>

    <p>Now that you know how to crop and resize images and then save them as 
      jpeg files, you are ready to start preparing your images for your web photo 
      album.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>First, crop and resize each of the three original images 
      once more to create viewable images that are 450 x 450 pixels in size.</li>
     <li>Next, crop and resize each of the three images to create thumbnail 
      images that are 72 pixels wide.</li>
     <li>All of these images should be optimized and exported in the jpeg file format. 
      Once you are done, you will have 6 images. Save the images to the <span class="filename">images</span> folder that you created in <a href="../../unit2/module1/lesson1.html">the early lesson on Pre-coding</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  </ul>

  <h2>All done?</h2>
  <p>Make sure to save your six exported images to your <em>images</em> 
subfolder. In the next lesson you will add 
    them to a web page to create the web photo album. If you have six web-ready images, 
    you are ready to proceed to <a href="lesson4.html">Lesson 4</a>.</p>
