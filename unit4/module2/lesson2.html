<h1>Lesson 2: Acquiring Images for Web Graphics</h1>



  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this lesson you will learn about different methods for acquiring digital 
    images to work with in the creation of web graphics. Depending upon the resources 
    available at your location, you will explore the use of scanning, digital 
    cameras, and finding and downloading images from the Web.</p>
  <p>In acquiring images, it is important to remember that images are 
    protected by copyright law and cannot be used unless written permission is 
    given by the owner of the copyright, or the image is in the public domain. 
    In this lesson you will be introduced to a number of websites that offer royalty-free or 
    public domain images for educational purposes.</p>

  <h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
  <p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use a scanner or digital camera to acquire images for use on web pages.</li>
    <li>find images on the Web from sites that have no restrictions that would prevent you from downloading and using their images on your own web site.</li>
    <li>download the images you find and store them for future use.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Activities</h2>
  <p>In the following activities you will collect images using a variety 
of methods and sources. <strong>Save all images in your <em>images</em> 
subfolder</strong>.</p>
<h3>Part 1:  Collecting images from Digital Devices</h3>

    <p>Your instructor will demonstrate how to acquire digital images through 
      scanning and/or uploading pictures from a digital camera, depending upon the 
      resources available at your location. If access to equipment is available, 
      you will acquire one image from each source. </p>
     <p>The images will eventually be used to make a mini web photo album where 
      the maximum picture size is 450 x 450 pixels. When scanning images or setting 
      the quality settings on your digital camera, remember to think about the 
      total number of pixels you are capturing and what final size you want the 
      image to appear on the web page. It is a good idea to capture an image that 
      has more pixels than you need, since a graphics program can be used to make 
      the image smaller, but can't make the image larger without lowering the 
      quality.</p>
	
	<h3>Part 2:  Collecting Images from the Web</h3>
	<p>
	    The
Internet provides a terrific source of images that can be used for your
web site, but you need to be careful about following copyright
restrictions. Remember what you learned about copyright and images on
the Internet though. Images on the web are protected by copyright law
and cannot be used unless written permission is given by the owner of
the copyright. Fortunately, though, there are conventions that have
been established for owners of copyrighted works to allow permission
for other people to use the works. As you already learned, images
placed in the public domain are free to be used without permission.
</p>

<p>Another source for images and other media is Creative Commons. &nbsp;Creative Commons
is a type of copyright license that allows people to share their work
and allow it to be reused by others under certain conditions. Below is a list of some commonly used Creative Commons licenses:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><img style="width: 88px; height: 31px;" alt="cc by" src="../pix/ccby.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;CC BY
(Attribution) - This license allows for others to reuse the work as
long as they provide credit to the author of the original creation.</li>

<li><img style="width: 88px; height: 31px;" alt="cc share alike" src="../pix/ccsa.png"> &nbsp;CC BY SA (Share Alike) - This license allows for others to reuse the work as long as they credit the original author and license any new creations under the same license.</li>

<li><img style="width: 88px; height: 31px;" alt="CC Non-Commercial" src="../pix/ccnc.png">
&nbsp;CC BY NC (Non Commercial) - This license allows for others to
reuse the work as long as the use is non-commercial and they provide
credit to the original author.</li>

</ul>

<p>Below is a list of some popular sites for obtaining images that can be used on web sites.</p>

<h4>Creative Commons</h4>

<p>When using Creative Commons images, make sure to look carefully at the
type of license being used and what the requirements are. More
information can be found on the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons web site</a>. The following are good sources of Creative Commons images:</p> 
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons Search</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">Flickr Creative Commons</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Government Web Sites</h4>
<p>Many government web sites provide public domain images for reuse, but not
all of the images there are in the public domain. Make sure you
look at the copyright license for each image.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/index.html">Great Images In NASA</a> (GRIN)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.doi.gov/gallery.html">US Department of the Interior Photo Library</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://images.fws.gov/">US Fish and Wildlife Service Digital Media Library</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/selected-internet/imagesources.html">Government Resources for Science Images</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Stock Photography Sites</h4>
<p>Stock photography sites require payment to use their images, but can be a
good choice if you are doing work for a commercial client.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/?gclid=COrMldDe36sCFQx3gwod3gRsOg">
	  Shutterstock</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/">iStockPhoto</a></li>
</ul>
    
<p>After you have looked at these sites, try searching on your own for sites
that offer creative commons, stock photography, royalty free images or
public domain images. Remember to look at the copyright requirements
and use restrictions for using images on these sites. Share any good
sites you find with your class. <strong>Acquire at least three images.</strong> 
At least one of the three images must be acquired from a digital device (as explained in Part 1) 
and at least one image must be acquired from the Web (as explained in Part 2). You will use these images in the next
lesson. If you were unable to acquire three images because you did not
have access to the necessary resources, your instructor may have images
to share.</p>
  
<h2>Resources/Online Documents</h2>
<ul>
	<li>scanner</li>
	<li>digital camera</li>
	<li>Internet access and ability to download image files</li>
</ul>

<h2>All done?</h2>
  <p>Make sure that you have acquired at least three images and have saved the 
    files to your <em>images</em> folder. You will be using these images 
to complete the following lesson.
    Once you have three images, proceed to <a href="lesson3.html">Lesson 3</a>.</p>
