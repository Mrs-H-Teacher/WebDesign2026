<h1>Web Graphics Basics</h1>


  <h2>Pixels</h2>
  <p>Computer based images are comprised of thousands of tiny dots of color called 
    pixels. These are the small dots you see if you put your face too close to 
    your television or computer screen. Each digital image is comprised of thousands 
    or millions of individual pixels, each with its own color. When these groups 
    of pixels are viewed as a whole, we see the entire image. Most computer monitors 
    have display sizes of 800x600 pixels, 1024x768 pixels, or 1280x1024 pixels. 
  </p>
  <h2>Resolution</h2>
  <p>Resolution indicates the number of pixels that are displayed per inch for 
    an image (or pixels per centimeter). Most computer monitors display at resolutions 
    of 72 pixels per inch or 96 pixels per inch. If an image is 72 pixels wide, 
    then it will display as 1 inch big on a monitor that is set to a resolution 
    of 72 pixels/inch. It is important to remember that for computer graphics, 
    a higher resolution (pixels/inch) does not mean a higher quality image. What 
    is important is the total size, in pixels, of the image.</p>
  <p><br />
    Graphics for print and graphics for display on computer monitors use different 
    resolutions. While monitors are constrained by the 72 or 96 pixel per inch 
    limitation, standard deskjet printers currently print in the range of 4800x1200 
    dpi (dots per inch) and pictures in magazines typically print at a resolution 
    of 150 dpi. Unlike computer graphics, with images for print, a higher resolution 
    will yield a higher quality image. Therefore, if you intend to print an image, 
    you want to use a higher resolution than you would for a web graphic to achieve 
a higher quality print.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, if you are scanning an image for use on a web page, what resolution should 
    you use? For display on a computer monitor, scanning an image at a higher 
    resolution will simply yield an image that displays larger on the screen, 
    since more total pixels are captured. For example, a 3 inch by 3 inch picture 
    scanned at a resolution of 72 pixels per inch will be 216 pixels wide and 
    216 pixels high and display as a 3 inch by 3 inch picture when displayed on 
    the computer monitor. A 3 inch by 3 inch picture scanned at a resolution of 
    144 pixels per inch will be 432 pixels wide and 432 pixels high and display 
    as a 6 inch by 6 inch picture when displayed on most computer monitors. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Therefore, the answer to the question of what resolution to scan images at 
    really depends on the size of the original picture and how big you want the 
    image to appear on the web page. Think about the total number of pixels you 
    are capturing instead of the pixels per inch. It is important to remember, 
    though, that it never hurts to capture an image onto the computer that is 
    larger than you need it (this is true for digital camera settings as well). 
    You can always use a graphics program to reduce the size of an image or crop 
    it without losing quality. If you try to make it larger using a graphics program, 
    however, the image will lose quality. A smaller image means that the image 
    contains fewer pixels, and a larger image has more pixels. You can always 
    throw away pixels that you have, but you can't add pixels that you don't have!</p>
  <h2>Graphics and File Size</h2>
  <p>Web designers are always caught in a constant compromise between image quality 
    and file size. Generally speaking, the higher the quality of the image, the 
    greater the file size will be. Also, the larger the image, the larger the 
    file size will be.</p>
  <p><br />
    It is important to consider the file size of images when using them on a web 
    page. Images with large file sizes take longer to load. Long load times can 
    be an annoyance to your audience and may render pages essentially unusable 
for those with slow Internet connections.</p>
  <h2>Graphic File Types</h2>
  <p>There are many different file types associated with graphics, however, only 
    a few types are suitable for web use. The most widely supported web image 
    formats are jpeg, gif, and png. The type of image dictates which image format 
    is best to use. </p>
  <p><br />
    <em>JPEG</em> (Joint Photographic Experts Group) &#8211; The jpeg image format 
    allows up to 16 million colors and is the best choice for image with many 
    colors or color gradations (especially photographs). Jpeg is a &#8220;lossy&#8221; 
    format which means that each time the image is saved and compressed, image 
    information is lost and quality is degraded. Jpeg images allow for various 
    levels of compression. Low compression means high image quality, but large 
file size. High compression means lower image quality, but smaller file size.</p>
  <p><br />
    <em>GIF</em> (Graphic Information Format) Gif is a &#8220;lossless&#8221; 
    image format, meaning that the quality of the image is not degraded through 
    compression. The limitation of gif images is that the color palette includes 
    only 256 colors. Therefore, the gif format is a good choice for simpler graphics 
    with a smaller number of solid colors. The gif format also allows for transparent 
    backgrounds, which allows the background color of the web page to show behind 
the graphic.</p>
  <p><br />
    <em>PNG</em> (Progressive Network Graphics) PNG is a newer image format that 
    provides a combination of many features of both jpeg and gif. The PNG format 
    allows for use of millions of colors as well as providing the ability to have 
    transparent backgrounds. The one drawback to PNG&#8217;s is that the format 
    is not supported by all web browsers, particularly older browsers.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em>Native file formats</em> &#8211; Native file formats are the formats 
    that the graphics editing programs use to save the graphic project files in. 
    The native file formats are larger in file size and contain all of the information 
    that allows the image to be edited. Examples of native file formats are .psd 
    for Photoshop and .png for Fireworks.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
  <p> <em>Other file formats</em> &#8211; Computer graphics may also be present 
    in a number of other different formats such as .bmp, .tiff, and .eps. These 
    formats have their particular uses, such as for print graphics, but are not 
    suitable for display on the web. To use one of these types of files on the 
    web, open it in your graphics program and then save it as either a jpeg, gif, 
    or png.<br />
