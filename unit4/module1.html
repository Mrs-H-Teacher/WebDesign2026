<h1>Module 1: Introduction to Web Graphics</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This module will introduce students to web graphics and provide an overview 
    of how images and color are displayed on the computer screen. Students will 
    learn about the purpose of graphics in web design and discuss various guidelines 
    for effective use of web graphics, including a review of accessibility 
    and usability concerns from Unit 1. The instructor will then lead students 
    through a scenario-based exercise to facilitate an understanding of copyright 
    issues with respect to web graphics.</p>
  <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to Web Graphics</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 30 - 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit4/module1/lesson1.html">Link to student Lesson 1 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
 <li>The first and second activities have questions to guide students' reading. You may want to conference with students informally using those questions. </li>
Student answers for Activity 7 may range from two answers to 10 depending on how well graphics are used on the site the student chooses.
 
 <li>Completion of activity three should be documented by students and linked to their portfolio. This is the first of many lessons that they will record and link to the portfolio, so be sure to monitor their understanding.</li>
 <li>Throughout this unit, students will be updating unit4.htm with new 
content, including links to the graphic files they've created. This is an 
opportunity for them to maintain the basic XHTML coding skill they've 
developed so far in the course. Advanced students should be encouraged to 
go a step beyond the requirements by adding style to their unit4.htm page 
using CSS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Output</h3>
  <p>When this lesson is complete, students will have added HTML content (answers to lesson questions) to <a href="../examples/unit4/module1/lesson1/graphics.html">graphics.html</a>.</p>
  
<h2>Lesson 2: Copyright Law and Graphics on the Web</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit4/module1/lesson2.html">Link to student Lesson 2 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
 <li>The first two activities in this lesson have questions to guide the students' reading. This is a great opportunity for group discussion or informal conferencing with individual students.</li>
 <li>This lesson includes a small group activity, in which groups of students are asked to review a set of four copyright scenarios. This activity can be expedited by assigning each scenario to a different group of students and have each group report out to the class regarding their scenario.</li>
</ul>
