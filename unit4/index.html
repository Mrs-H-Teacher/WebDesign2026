<h1>Unit 4: Graphics</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This unit offers relief from the coding of Units 2 and 3. Student may appreciate the different type of learning.</p>

<p>There are four modules in this unit, plus a <em>Reflections</em> module at the end.
   In the first module students will be 
    introduced to using graphics in web design and learn about what constitutes 
    effective use of web graphics. In the second module, students will acquire 
    digital images and then learn how to crop and resize the images so they can 
    be displayed on web pages. In the third module, students will utilize simple 
    drawing tools and layers in graphics software to create simple web graphics 
    and buttons. In the fourth module, students will learn about selection tools, 
    tools for image manipulation, and blending techniques. The outcome of these modules will 
    be several images that students use to enhance their portfolio website.</p>
    
<p>Each of the activities can be completed using any major graphic software application. Since this curriculum is vendor-neutral, the instructions are intentionally general, and do not include specific step-by-step instructions for any particular software. Consequently you will need to preview these lessons and be sure you understand how to complete the activities using your graphic software.</p>
 
<p>Consider having advanced students create video tutorials to accompany the activities in this unit, demonstrating the specific steps using your graphic software. These tutorials could be excellent teaching tools for all students in the class, including the students who create them. These could be created with screen recording and video editing software such as <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">TechSmith Camtasia</a> or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html">Adobe Captivate</a>.</p> 
    
<p class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 11 to 17 hours</p>
