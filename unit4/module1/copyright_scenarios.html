<h1>Copyright Scenarios</h1>


  <ol>
    <li>Students in Mr. Johnson's web design class have been given an assignment 
      to make a personal website. Timmy Thompson, a student in the class, loves 
      snowboarding and wants to put some snowboarding pictures on his personal 
      site. The only problem is that he doesn't have any good pictures of himself. 
      So, Timmy searches for snowboarding images in his favorite search engine 
      and finds a site with a number of good pictures he would like to use. He 
      looks everywhere on the site, but doesn't see anything written that says 
      the images are protected by copyright. Timmy downloads a few of the images 
      and uses them on his personal website on the hobbies page. Although he 
      is tempted to try and impress other students by passing the pictures off 
      as his own, Timmy is a man of good conscience, and under each picture he 
      cites the source of the image to give credit to the owner. From what you 
      have learned about copyright law, would Timmy's use of the images be acceptable?</li>
    <li>For their second project, students in Mr. Johnson's web design class have 
    	been instructed to create a website about their favorite place. 
    	The class just finished an activity where they learned about copyright law
    	and Mr. Johnson warns the students that points will be deducted from
    	their final score if he finds any copyright violations. Not wanting to 
    	jeopardize his grade, Timmy Thompson gets his parents to drive him to 
    	his favorite place and takes pictures to use on his website. &nbsp;If
    	Timmy puts the pictures he took on his web site, will they be copyrighted? 
    	Can other people take them and use them?</li>
		<li>When he gets to class the next 
      day, students present their finished sites to the class. Timmy notices that 
      Susie Simpson has used a bunch of pictures on her website that he knows 
      must have been taken by a professional photographer. She didn't even cite 
      the source of the images. Timmy complains to Mr. Johnson that he thinks 
      Susie used copyrighted images on her website. Susie defends herself, claiming 
      that she got the images off of a U.S. government website and was allowed 
      to use the images without restrictions because they were in the public domain. 
      From what you have learned about copyright law, would Susy's use of the 
      images be acceptable?</li>
    <li>As a final project in Mr. Johnson's class, students have been tasked with 
      creating a website for a local business in the community. Timmy Thompson 
      picks his aunt's restaurant since he knows that she doesn't have a website 
      already. While searching the Internet for ideas, Timmy comes across a stock 
      photography website that has some really good close-up pictures of different 
      types of food. These images would be perfect for his project, so Timmy reads 
      the usage restrictions for the images. The images require payment for commercial use, 
      but are offered free for not-for-profit or educational use. 
      Since Timmy is doing the project for a school assignment, he believes that 
      falls under educational use, so he downloads the images and uses them in his project. 
      Timmy completes the final website and receives praise from everyone, including 
      his aunt and Mr. Johnson, about how nice the site looks. From what you have 
      learned about copyright law, would Timmy's use of the images be acceptable?
