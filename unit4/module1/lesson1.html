<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Web Graphics</h1>


  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p> Before you start learning how to create graphics for your web pages, it 
    is important to think about how graphics can be used effectively to enhance 
    pages without creating accessibility and usability problems. In this lesson, 
    you will learn about the purpose of graphics in web design and discuss guidelines 
    for effective use of web graphics.</p>
  <h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
  <p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>identify what constitutes purposeful use of web graphics</li>
    <li>identify guidelines for effective use of graphics on web pages</li>
    <li>utilize graphics for web design in a manner that minimizes accessibility 
      and usability impacts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Activities</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>See the web page <a href="guidelines_for_web_graphics.html">Purpose 
      and Guidelines for Effective Use of Web Graphics</a>. Look over the three items  
      that discuss the purpose of graphics in web design. Why do 
      you think it is important that generally speaking it is good practice to 
      let the content of the page lead the graphics on the page and not the other 
      way around? Can you think of any situations where this may not be the case? 
    </li>
    <li>In the same handout, read the section titled <em>Guidelines 
      for effective use of web graphics</em>. For each guideline, think about why you 
      think that guideline is important to web design. Remember what you learned about good 
      design principles and accessibility in Unit 1. Can you think of any additional 
      guidelines for effective use of web graphics that have not been listed?</li>
    <li>Open the blank web page <span class="filename">graphics.html</span>, which you created in 
the Unit 2 lesson on <a href="../../unit2/module2/lesson2.html">Essential Tags</a>. You will now 
populate this page with several sections of content, each section related 
to a different lesson in the current unit. 
	</li>
	<li>Be sure the web page has a <strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong> 
element that is reflective of the purpose of this page (if you followed the instructions carefully in Unit 2, the title should be something like "Web Portfolio: <span class="highlight">Your Name</span>'s Graphics Page")</li>
	<li>As you may have learned by now in earlier lessons, the 
title specified using the <span class="element">&lt;title&gt;</span> element does not 
show up in the body of the document. So, it's a common practice to add 
this same title, or a similar one, to the body of the document as a main heading, like 
this: 
<div class="example">
&lt;h1&gt;Web Portfolio: Graphics&lt;/h1&gt;
</div>
</li>
<li>Your web page will include this main heading, as well as several 
subheadings. Following these guidelines in entering your first subheading:
<ul>
 <li>Use <span class="element">&lt;h2&gt;</span>...<span class="element">&lt;/h2&gt;</span> to 
identify your subheading as a level-2 subheading.</li>
 <li>The text of your subheading should be: <strong>Evaluation of web 
graphics</strong></li>
 <li>Add an <span class="attribute">id</span> attribute to the opening <span class="element">&lt;h2&gt;</span> tag, like this: 
 <div class="example">&lt;h2 id="evaluation"/&gt;</div> 
 <p>This will allow you to link directly to this section using a URL that includes a filename like <span class="filename">graphics.html#evaluation</span>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go on to the Internet and find a web page of your choice. Identify where graphic images have been used on the page. Back to your <span class="filename">graphics.html</span> file, under the new "Evaluation of web graphics" subheading, use any HTML tags that you feel are appropriate to record the title and URL of the site you chose, and your responses to the following two questions:
   <ol>
		<li>Referring to the section in the handout titled <em>Purpose of graphics in web design</em>, what do you feel is the purpose of the graphics on the page you selected?</li> 
    <li>Referring to the section in the handout titled <em>Guidelines for  
      effective use of web graphics</em>, how well does the page you selected meet these guidelines? Which guidelines does it do especially well on, if any? Which guidelines does it fail to meet?</li>
  	</ol>
  </li>
 </ol>
