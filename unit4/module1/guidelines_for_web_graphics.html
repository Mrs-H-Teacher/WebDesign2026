<h1>Purpose and Guidelines for Effective Use of Web Graphics</h1>


<h2>Purpose of graphics in web design</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Graphics add visual/aesthetic appeal to the information on the web page, helping to maintain viewer interest and attention
  </li>
  <li>Help to create visual structure for information and links on the page
  </li>
  <li>Communicate or explain ideas visually
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Guidelines for effective use of web graphics</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Graphics should fit in with the purpose, organization, and style 
      of the page.</strong> They should enhance the design, structure, or informative 
      content of the web page without distracting attention. As much as you may 
      want to add an image to a page because it shows off some fancy new effect 
      you learned in the graphics program, think first about whether it fits in 
      or not. You may want to keep these types of graphics in your personal portfolio 
      under the heading, &#8220;Cool Effects I Know in My Graphics Program.&#8221;</li>
    <li><strong> Avoid using graphics with large file sizes that add to the load 
      time of the page.</strong> Also, consider the cumulative file size of all 
      images on the page. Excessive &#8220;page weight&#8221; caused by poor image 
      use can result in slow load times for pages. According to the Yale University 
      Web Style Guide, 2nd Edition, &quot;At today's average modem speeds most 
      pages designed for users dialing in from home should contain no more than 
      50 to 75 kilobytes of graphics.&quot;</li>
    <li><strong> Graphics should help to guide the viewers&#8217; focus to the 
      important content on the page. </strong>Using visually strong graphic elements 
      on a page can be useful in directing viewers' attention and providing structure 
      for the page. Be careful, though. Strong graphic elements can also pull 
      attention away from central content or compete with one another on the page. 
      This results in the page appearing overly busy or cluttered and makes it 
      difficult to read. Remember, if you attempt to emphasize everything then 
      nothing ends up standing out. </li>
    <li><strong> Avoid repetitive use of overly bright or potentially &#8220;obnoxious&#8221; 
      images.</strong> These types of &quot;eye catching&quot; images may be attractive 
      at first, but after the novelty wears off, they may cause viewers to lose 
      patience with the site. While an animation of a dancing monkey may seem 
      interesting and funny at first, over time it may become annoying and drive 
      viewers away.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid the use of graphics to convey textual content information.</strong> 
      While it may be tempting from a design standpoint to use images for textual 
      information because of the greater number of design options such as font 
      choices and text effects, graphic based text presents a variety of problems: 
      Images of text can't be resized like true text, so users with poor vision are unable to       resize 
      it to meet their visual needs; images require much longer to download than text; 
      users can't search for images of text using their browser's <em>find</em> feature; and          search engines are better able to index websites that contain actual text, 
     well-structured with HTML. </li>     
    <li><strong>Provide textual equivalent alternatives for graphic content.</strong> 
      Remember that not all users are able to see the images on your web page. 
      Whenever images are used, it is important to provide equivalent content 
      or descriptions of the image in a textual format. The most common way this 
      is done is to provide descriptive text using the <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute. This is 
      especially important where images are used as navigation buttons or links. 
      For a more in depth look at using alternate text with graphics to improve 
      accessibility, read the section on <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/11-graphics/8-web-graphics-markup.html">Graphics Markup</a> within the Web Style Guide.</li>
    <li><strong>When using text in graphics, make sure there is sufficient contrast 
      between the text and the background color.</strong> Design graphic elements 
      so that users can easily distinguish the text from 
      its background. Also, be sure to avoid color combinations (reds and greens 
      for example) that color blind users will not be able to distinguish apart 
      from one another.
    </li>
