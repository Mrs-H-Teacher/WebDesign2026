<h1>Copyright Scenario Answer Key</h1>


<p>In the Unit 4 lesson on <a href="../../student/unit4/module1/lesson2.html">Copyright Law and Graphics on the Web</a> students are asked to review and discuss the legality of <a href="../../student/unit4/module1/copyright_scenarios.html">four copyright scenarios</a>. Following are explanations of the ideas presented in each scenario.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>While it was a noble gesture on Timmy's part to cite the source of the 
      image, his actions would still most likely be a violation of copyright law. 
      Images do not need to present a written notice of copyright to be protected 
      by copyright law. In fact, it is just the opposite. Images on the Internet 
      are protected by copyright law and cannot be used unless written consent 
      is given by the owner allowing their use. Just because someone cites the 
      source of an image, does not make it acceptable for them to use it. It is 
      a good practice to assume that you cannot use an image unless there is a 
      written statement saying that you can.</li>
    <li>It was good that Timmy went out and took his own pictures to use on his 
      website. That is definitely the safest way to avoid violating copyright 
      law. These images are Timmy's intellectual property and as such are protected 
      by copyright law unless Timmy expressly grants others the right to use them.</li> 
		<li>Timmy's criticism of Susie was most likely incorrect. While it 
      is true that most images on the Internet are protected by copyright, there 
      are certain websites that allow for use of the images on them. Most images 
      produced or created by U.S. government sources are considered to be in the 
      public domain and do not have usage restrictions on them. It is still important 
      to check for a copyright notice, however, since some images on U.S. government 
      websites may have been created by non-government sources or contractors 
      and are therefore not in the public domain. Most of the time the U.S. government 
      websites do a good job of identifying which images are public domain and 
      which are not. It is not necessarily required that public domain images 
      be cited when used on another website, but it is often requested as a courtesy 
      to cite the source of the images when using them.</li>
    <li>Whether or not Timmy's use of the images was acceptable depends 
      upon what the final intended use of the web page is. As a classroom assignment, 
      it was perfectly acceptable for Timmy to use the images from the stock photography 
      site without paying since the usage restrictions allowed for educational 
      or not-for-profit use. However, if Timmy's aunt wanted to actually use the website  
      for her restaurant, it would not be acceptable to use the images 
      without payment since that would constitute a commercial use. Unless the 
      appropriate fees are paid to the stock photography company to use the images, 
      Timmy is left with a great class project, but his aunt can't use the pages 
      with the images without violating copyright law.
