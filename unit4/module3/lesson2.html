<h1>Lesson 2: Working With Layers</h1>


<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p> In this lesson, you will learn about how layers work and then
experiment with adjusting the stacking of layers to create your button.
You will also be shown how to duplicate layers and then adjust layers
so that they are visible or hidden.</p>

<h2>Learner Outcomes:</h2>
<p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>utilize layers to adjust the stacking order of objects.</li>
	<li>adjust layers so that they are visible or hidden.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<h3>Part 1:  Creating a basic button</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read <a href="layer_basics.html">Layer Basics</a>
to develop an understanding of how the concept of layers works. Then,
your instructor will demonstrate how to work with layers in the
particular software product being used by the class.  </li>
<li>In this activity you will use the basic button shape you
created in Lesson 1 to create an email button for your portfolio.
 Make sure you have it open in your graphics program.</li>
<li>Next, download the image of an envelope, <span class="filename">mail.png</span>, by right
clicking on the image below and saving it to your computer.
You will use this image for your email button.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img style="background: rgb(204, 204, 204) none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; width: 75px; height: 75px;" alt="envelope image" src="../pix/mail.png"></span><br> <br>
</li>
<li>Now, open <span class="filename">mail.png</span> in your graphics program. Use
the selection tool to draw a box around the image and then copy it by
using CTRL+C on your keyboard (Command+C for Mac users).
 Then, switch back to the button shape you created in Lesson
1.  Create a new blank layer and then paste the envelope image
into the layer by using CTRL+V on your keyboard (Command+V for Mac
users).</li>
<li>Experiment with using layers to create more complex designs
for your button. Try adding the descriptive text "email" to your button
by adding a new text layer.  Play with the positioning and
layer order to see how they effect the look of your button.</li>
<li>If you want to make an entire set of buttons, you don't
have to start from scratch.  You can use the shape you've
already made to make more buttons by using the show and hide layer
feature.  In Part 2, we'll create an additional button that
will link to the photo album you created earlier in this unit.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Part 2:  Creating additional buttons</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, download the image of a camera, <span class="filename">camera.png</span>, by right
clicking on the
image below and saving it to your computer.  You will use this
image
for your photo button.<br>
<br>
<img style="background: rgb(204, 204, 204) none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; width: 75px; height: 75px;" alt="envelope image" src="../pix/camera.png"><br> </li><li>Now,
open <span class="filename">camera.png</span> in your graphics program.  Use
the selection tool to draw a box around the image and then copy it by
using CTRL+C on your keyboard (Command+C for Mac users).
 Then, switch back to your button shape and hide the layer with
the envelope image on it.  In most graphics programs, there will
be a small eyeball icon next to each layer.  Click on the eyeball
icon to hide the layer.  </li>
<li>Next, create a new blank layer and then paste the camera image
into the layer by using CTRL+V on your keyboard (Command+V for Mac
users).  You should now have a button with the camera image using the same background you did for your email button.</li>
<li>Try playing with additional shapes and images to create more buttons.  The <a href="http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/">Open Icon Library</a> is a good location to find images and icons to use on your web pages.</li>
</ol>
<h2>All done?</h2>
<p>Remember to save your project. You will finish the button
project in <a href="lesson3.html">the next lesson</a>.</p>
