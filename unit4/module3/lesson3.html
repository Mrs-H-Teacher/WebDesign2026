<h1>Lesson 3: Optimizing GIF Images</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> In this lesson, you will optimize the button you have created
for exporting as a gif image. You will experiment with different export
settings and then make comparisons regarding file size and image
quality. Using the hide layer feature, you will adjust which button
text is visible and export five different buttons.</p>

<h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>At the completion of this exercise, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>optimize and export gif images.</li>
	<li>use layer visibility to streamline graphic projects.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the sections on "Image Formats" and "JPG and PNG
Basics" in Webmonkey's <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/site_optimization_tutorial/">Site
Optimization Tutorial</a>. Then, the instructor will demonstrate
how to use the optimization feature in the graphics software being
used. Export one of your buttons multiple times, using different
settings each time. Next,compare the file size and image quality of the
different exported files to determine the best settings to use. </li>
<li>First,
hide the layer with the camera image and make sure the layer with the
mail image is visible.  Export your button multiple times
using
different settings each time for the number of colors in your gif.
 Compare the images to see which export settings give you the
best
balance of high quality and low file size.</li>
<li>Once you have
determined the best settings to use, hide the layer with the mail image
and make the image with the camera image visible.  Now export
your
button again, saving it with a different filename.  You should
now
have two buttons exported, one for your email button and one for your
camera button.</li>
<li>Once you have exported your buttons,
create a new section in your <span class="filename">graphics.html</span> web page with heading "Sample
Buttons" and <span class="attribute">id="buttons"</span>. Add code to this section that will display your two
buttons. Try coming up with this code on your own, but if you get stuck, refer back to the earlier lesson on <a href="../module2/lesson4.html">adding images to your web page</a>.</li>
<li>Once you've finished adding your buttons to <span class="filename">graphics.html</span>, add 
the email button to the header of your portfolio site's home page 
(<span class="filename">index.html</span>). Position the button directly above or adjacent to your email
address that is already there. If the image is too large to fit, you can resize it slightly by changing the values of the <span class="attribute">width</span> and <span class="attribute">height</span> attributes.</li>
<li>After you've positioned the email button where you want it on your home page, add an email link to the image, targeting your email address. This way, users can send you an email by clicking on the email button.</li>
<li>Next, in the Unit 4 section of your portfolio home page, add the camera button, and link that image to your <span class="filename">graphics.html</span> file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Resources/Online Documents</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Webmonkey: <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/site_optimization_tutorial/">Site Optimization Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>All done?</h2>
<p>Make sure to add the buttons you created to the page for
graphics projects in your portfolio website so your instructor can
evaluate your work. When finished, proceed to the <a href="lesson4.html">next lesson</a>.</p>
