<h1>Layer Basics</h1>


  <h2>How do Layers Work?</h2>
  <p>
<img src="../pix/layers_example.gif" alt="drawing of four rectangles 
stacked on top of one another, labeled Layer 1 through Layer 4 from top to

Most advanced graphics applications organize image objects using layers. To understand 
    layers, picture sheets of glass that are stacked on top of each other. You 
    can add images or text onto each of these different sheets of glass and then 
    work on them separately without affecting any of the images on the other sheets 
    of glass. While each of the images are on a separate sheet of glass, when 
    you look down from above, however, all the different images on the different 
    sheets of glass appear as one image. The images on the top sheets of glass 
    appear to overlap the images on the lower sheets of glass. </p>
    
  <p style="clear:right"><img src="../pix/layers_panel.gif" alt="screen shot of a Layers Panel 
from a graphics program" width="209" height="231" style="float:right;border:1px solid black;margin:0 10px 20px 20px">Layers 
    in graphics software work in this same way. Each layer is transparent and can 
    contain different images or text. Although these layers can be worked on independently, 
    when you look at the top view, it appears as one image. The advantage of layers 
    is that it allows you to manipulate different components within a graphic 
    without affecting the other layers. You can add and delete layers, apply effects 
    to layers, move layers around, and adjust the stacking order of the layers. 
    Layers are usually organized in some type of layers panel as shown in the 
    example to the right.</p>
    
  <h2>Layer Properties</h2>
  <p>You can select individual layers by clicking on them in the layers panel. 
    When working on your graphics, always be sure that you are on the correct 
    layer of the image you are manipulating. It is easy to lose track of which 
    layer you are on and then inadvertently make changes to objects on another 
    layer.</p>
  <p>Layers can also be renamed and organized into folders. It is a good idea 
    to name your layers and keep them organized in folders. This is especially 
    true in larger projects where there can be a considerable number of layers 
    to deal with.</p>
  <h2>Layer Visibility</h2>
  <p>One other feature of layers that is nice is that you can toggle whether a 
    layer is visible or hidden. It is common for software programs to use an eye 
    image next to the layer to indicate that it is visible. To hide a layer, simply 
    click the eye icon so that it disappears. Hiding layers allows you to try 
    different things when creating a graphic and then see which one you like better 
    without having to erase the old idea and start all over. It also is useful 
    for creating multiple graphics of a similar nature from the same graphics 
    file. For example, you could make a basic button shape and then create additional 
    layers with the text for all of the different buttons you want. Instead of 
    creating a new file for each button, simply toggle which text layer is visible 
    and then export the graphic.</p>
