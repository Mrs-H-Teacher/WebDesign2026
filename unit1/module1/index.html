<h1>Basic Site Evaluation and Rubric Creation</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>These two lessons give you a basic understanding of the principles 
behind effective website design and implementation. You're probably eager 
to get started developing your first websites, but first things first! Web design requires careful planning and consideration of what it is exactly that defines a good website. In this module, you will visit a variety of websites and explore what you perceive to be good and bad qualities of each.</p>
<p>Also in this module, you will develop a tool for measuring website quality. This tool will be used throughout the course and will be used in evaluating the quality of your own work. </p>
