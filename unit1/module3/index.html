<h1>Module 3: Web Standards and Accessible Design</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this module is to assure that your web projects are accessible to all possible users. Computer users are incredibly diverse. They access the Web using a wide variety of browsers on different operating systems. They have different screen resolutions, font sizes, and color schemes. Many users access the Web on tablet computers with touch screens, or on mobile phones. Many users have disabilities and access the web with custom configurations or using assistive technologies. Web standards are the rules that govern how web pages are built so they work for all these different users. In this module you will learn about standard web coding languages, HTML and CSS, and will learn about the different versions of HTML that are available. You will also learn how web pages can erect barriers for users with disabilities if they aren't designed and coded properly, and will learn about accessibility standards that help you to create web pages that are fully accessible to everyone. </p>
