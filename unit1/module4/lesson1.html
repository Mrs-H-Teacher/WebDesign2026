<h1>Lesson 1: Organizing a Website</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A key to successfully designing a large website is to organize the 
information logically, so that users can easily locate the information they're looking
  for. The first step in organizing a website is a concept called 
&quot;chunking,&quot;,
  dividing the site's content into manageable chunks of information, with all
  chunks related conceptually to one another. Content within each chunk can then
  be arranged hierarchically, so that the most important topics within a chunk
  will appear first in a navigational system.</p>
<h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>

<p>At the completion of this exercise:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>you will be able to apply theories and techniques to effectively organize content on a web site</li>
   <li>you  will be able to explain principles of information architecture  including the five basic steps to organizing information on a web page  and the three essential structures for organizing web sites</li>
   <li>you  will be able to organize web content by creating a navigation system  that appropriately chunks web content and allows users to quickly, easily access important content</li>
</ul>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Read the Web Style Guide chapter on 
        <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/index.html">Information Architecture</a>. </li>
			<li><strong>Reading Check</strong>. Write or type your reponses to the following questions. 
Have your instructor review your answers.
			  <ol>
				<li>List the five basic steps to organizing information for a website.</li>
				<li>Briefly describe the three essential structures for organizing websites. </li>
			    <li>How might programmers utilize site diagrams as they move a new website project from planning to production? </li>
			  </ol>
			</li>
			<li>Receive a set of index cards from your teacher and read the following
			  scenario:
              <p>You have been hired by a client whose website has gotten
                      unwieldy after years of willy-nilly development. The 
client
  is wanting the site to be better organized, starting from the ground
                    up. Each of the cards you received includes a different topic
  that is addressed on the client's website. </p>
			</li>
            <li>
              <p>Organize the cards into meaningful
          chunks and propose to the client a new navigational system, where each
                chunk represents a link on the navigational menu of the home
                page. Write or type your navigation links and show them 
to your instructor. 
The navigational system should successfully balance the
                following needs: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>There should be no more than ten chunks</li>
                <li>Every page on the website should be no more than three 
clicks away from the home page.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
</ol>
<h2>Resources/Online Documents</h2>

</ul>

  <h2>All done?</h2>
<p>Turn in your answers to the Reading Check and show your instructor  
your proposed organization of the website. Then, proceed to <a href="../../unit2/index.html">Unit 2</a>.</p>
