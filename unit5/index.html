<h1>Unit 5: Scripting</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>  
<p>Few web pages today are designed in isolation. Each page is typically part of a much larger site, with a common user interface providing visitors with a cohesive sense of place. Consistency across pages on a site benefits users, since they don't have to find the bearings with each new page, and can instead focus on the site content. It also benefits the owner of the site as they provide a comfortable environment that users will enjoy returning to. In this lesson, students learn about organizing website content and providing a navigational system that is consistent across the site. Students also learn about server-side technologies that allow common code to be shared by multiple files across the site, including external style sheets and server-side includes. 
</p>   
<p>This unit can be very challenging for some students, but it can also be very rewarding, especially for students who are comfortable working through abstract code. For those who aren't, it's important for them not to get discouraged. Help them to do their best, but remind them that most real world web design and development is done in teams, with all team members bringing unique skills to the table. Some are good at writing code, others are good and creating graphics or laying out visual designs, others are good at working with clients and helping to translate their needs into a deliverable product. Depending on how many students are struggling with this content, portions of it (for example, the hands-on JavaScript exercises in Module 2, Lessons 2 through 5) could be setup as extra-credit activities for advanced students.</p>
