<h1>Unit 3: Formatting Web Pages with Style Sheets</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This unit is the sequel to the proceeding unit, in which students learned the basics of HTML code, but focused solely on the content and structure of web documents. In this unit, students learn how to control the visual presentation of web documents using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Like the proceeding unit, this unit can be completed entirely with a web browser and HTML editor.</p>

	<p>In the first three modules of this unit students generally fare well, but in modules 4 - 6 some students begin to have difficulty and to tire from all the coding they've been doing since the beginning of Unit 2. It's important for instructors to be prepared for this and to try to prevent it by making CSS exciting. Throughout Unit 2, students were probably lamenting that their web pages were dull-looking, and asking how to add features that were visual in nature (like centering text, creating multiple columns, changing text or background colors, using a different font, etc.) Now is their chance! With CSS they can finally make their website visually appealing!</p>
	
	<p>One way to keep students motivated may be to explore other sites that use CSS especially well. The <a href="../requirements.html">Software and Hardware Requirements</a> page lists several toolbars that are available for various browsers. These toolbars make it easy to toggle CSS off and on with a single click or hotkey. It can be an interesting exercise to view web pages without CSS, then turn CSS back on to view the amazing transformation. One popular site that can be used for exploring the power of CSS is <a href="http://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a>, a site where each page has exactly the same content and structure, but has a unique and visually rich appearance, attained solely through CSS (with extensive use of background images). Encourage students to bring in other examples of sites that use CSS especially well and share them with the class.</p>
