<h1>Lesson 1: Understanding Typography in CSS</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this lesson you will learn the basics of <span class="term">typography</span> as it applies to web pages. Typography is the art and technique of arranging type on a page. The font family, style, size, and weight (or thickness) all play a role in typography on the Web, as does the spacing between lines and letters. All of this can be controlled using CSS.</p>
  
<h2>Learner Outcomes</h2>
<p>At the completion of this exercise:</p>
<ul>
	<li>you will have identified four guidelines for using typography effectively on web pages.</li>
	<li>you will have evaluated several web pages on whether they effectively follow the above guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Read John Boardley's <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2008/02/28/a-guide-to-web-typography/">Guide to Web Typography</a>. In this article, the author (John Boardley) describes how to use contrast, size, hierarchy, and space effectively.</li>
	<li>Next, browse the Web and find web pages that are good examples and bad examples of each of the four principles described in the article. This will be a total of eight pages - one good and one bad example of each principle. Simply browse through a variety of web pages and ask yourself:
		<ul>
			<li>Does this page have good <strong>contrast</strong>?</li>
			<li>Does this page use <strong>font sizes</strong> that are easy to read, even for people with poor vision?</li>
			<li>Does this page use <strong>hierarchy</strong> effectively? Is the page organized into a clear structure (with obvious headings and subheadings?)</li>
			<li>Is <strong>space</strong> used effectively? Is there plenty of empty space around blocks of content? Does the page avoid having content that's overly cluttered or cramped?</li>
		</ul>
		If you have trouble finding good or bad examples, you might be able to fill in the gaps by doing an Internet search for &quot;web pages with good typography&quot; or &quot;web pages with bad typography&quot;
	</li>
	<li>Make a list of the web pages you found, and discuss them with your instructor or class. Be prepared to explain why you think they're good or bad examples.</li>
	</li>
</ol>
