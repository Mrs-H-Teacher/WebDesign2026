<h1>Module 3: Typography in CSS</h1>

         
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this module, the two lesson help students to first <em>understand</em> typography on web pages, then <em>apply</em> that knowledge to their portfolio sites.</p>

<h2>Lesson 1: Understanding Typography in CSS</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 30 - 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit3/module3/lesson1.html">Link to student Lesson 1 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>This lesson includes a short assessment based on assigned reading. As in similar lessons earlier in the curriculum, this assessment could be conducted over email, or using an online survey or assessment tool.</li>
	<li>Travis Hitchcock has produced an interesting <a href="http://prezi.com/ufnrer-swszq/typography">Pretzl Presentation on Typography</a> that you may want to share and discuss with your students at the start of this lesson.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lesson 2: Applying Typography in CSS</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 60 - 90 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit3/module2/lesson2.html">Link to student Lesson 2 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>This is a very long lesson and may require multiple class sessions. The most crucial activities are those numbered 8 through 13, in which students add a pair of font-family properties to their external CSS file. If your students’ interest is waning in this lesson, consider how you can trim down the earlier activities and focus on these latter  activities.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Output</h3>
  <p>When this lesson is complete, students will have applied typography-related styles to their site by changing <a href="../examples/unit3/module3/lesson2/styles/mystyle.css">the external CSS file</a>. These changes should be visible on any web page within their site, including <a href="../examples/unit3/module3/lesson2/index.html">index.html</a>.</p>
