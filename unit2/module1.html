<h1>Module 1: Pre-coding</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Unit 2, students begin their introduction to web design 
techniques. It is common for students at this point in the course to have 
ideas about what they want their web pages to look like. However, in most 
real world web pages, what pages &quot;look like&quot; is secondary. A 
more important first question is: &quot;What do I want my web page to 
say?&quot; This course places an emphasis on content first, presentation 
second. The strength of this approach to web design is that it lends 
itself to designing web pages that are robust, with content that is 
flexible and deliverable to users regardless of which web-enabled 
technologies or configurations they're using. The creed among web 
developers who pratice this approach, and among standards organizations 
who promote it, is that content and structure should be separate from 
presentation. In this course, we will be focusing in Unit 2 on content and 
structure using HTML. Later, in Unit 3, we will turn our attention to 
presentation using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>

<p>In Unit 2, students will construct a website that will serve as a portfolio 
for displaying the work they complete in this course. This portfolio will continue to play a key role throughout the course.</p>

<p>In the current module module, students will be introduced to the pre-coding steps that 
    are helpful to go through before they begin working with the nuts and bolts 
    of web page development: coding in HTML. Just as there are pre-writing steps 
    that ought to be done prior to writing an essay, there are pre-coding steps 
    to do before coding a website. It is important for the instructor to reinforce 
    that planning ahead will reduce the number of mistakes they'll make while 
    constructing the site, which will save time, and in the working world will save money.</p>

<h2>Lesson 1: Pre-Coding (Lesson length 60 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 30 - 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit2/module1/lesson1.html">Link to student Lesson 1 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
 <li>Students are always eager to get started constructing their website. The tendency for most students is to skip preliminary planning and start coding a site from the onset.  Emphasize that initially in the process of developing a website the developer should spend plenty of time communicating with the client to understand what the clients needs are. Using paper to develop a preliminary sketch and file diagram reinforces the notion that planning ought to be done first. </li>
 <li>When students are ready to set up their folder structure, it can be helpful for students to watch the instructor step through the process. Proceed slowly and emphasize the naming protocol for folders and files that are created in this activity, since these folders and files will be referenced extensively throughout the curriculum, especially when linking to content between files. This is especially critical if your class is structured in a way that encourages students to begin working at their own pace.</li>  
	<li>Some students may have grand ideas and may sketch a complex site and design that is beyond the scope of this course. Be honest with these students that their designs may require advanced skills beyond those taught in the course, but if these students prove throughout the course to have the aptitude to learn the advanced skills required, their original sketch can be used to motivate them. Perhaps by the end of the course they will have successfully realized their vision.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Output</h3>

<p>When this lesson is complete, students will have created a blank home page 
and three sub-folders.</p>
