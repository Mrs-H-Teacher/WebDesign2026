<h1>Module 1: Pre-coding</h1>


  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Unit 2, you begin your introduction to web design techniques. At 
this point in the course, you may already have ideas about what 
you want 
your web pages to look like. However, in most real-world web pages, what 
pages &quot;look like&quot; is secondary. A more important first question 
is: &quot;What do I want my web page to say?&quot; This course places an 
emphasis on content first, presentation second. The strength of this 
approach to web design is that it lends itself to designing web pages that 
are robust, with content that is flexible and deliverable to users 
regardless of which web-enabled technologies or configurations they're 
using. The creed among web developers who pratice this approach, and among 
standards organizations who promote it, is that content and structure 
should be separate from presentation. In this course, Unit 2 will focus on 
content and structure using HTML. Later, in Unit 3, we will turn our 
attention to presentation using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>

<p>In this module, you will construct a website that will serve as a portfolio 
    for displaying the work you complete in this course. This portfolio will continue to play a key role throughout the course.</p>

<p>Also, you will be introduced to the planning steps (called 
<em>pre-coding</em>) that you need  
    to go through before you begin working with the nuts and bolts 
    of coding your website using HTML. Just as there are pre-writing 
steps 
    that ought to be done prior to writing an essay, there are pre-coding steps 
    to do before coding a website. </p>
