<h1>Module 2: Testing Usability</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This module introduces the topic of usability testing through a hands-on class exercise. The lessons learned in this module extend beyond the world of web design, as most companies who produce products have individuals or groups who are responsible for testing those products with actual users, observing those users as they interact with the product. By doing so, much can be learned about how uses interact with the product, and that information can be used to make the product better.</p>

 <h2>Lesson 1: Conducting a Usability Test</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 60 - 90 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit6/module2/lesson1.html">Link to student Lesson 1 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
 <li>If students are working independently through the material in this course, it may be challenging to form groups. We recommend that you place the responsibility in the hands of the students to find the peer subjects they will observe in their usability study. To ensure that all students have equal opportunity to participate as subjects, limits could be placed on the number of times any student is allowed to serve as a subject.</li>
 <li>If possible have a video camera available to capture the usability tests. The video footage can be used to supplement the hand-written notes, and students can learn even more about a site's usability by comparing their notes with their observations while watching the video. Usually students see a lot more when reviewing the video. Plus it’s fun!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Output</h3>
  <p>When this lesson is complete, students will have added the results of a usability test to their <a href="../examples/unit6/module2/lesson1/usability.html">usability.html</a> file.</p>
