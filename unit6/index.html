<h1>Unit 6: Quality Control</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this unit you are introduced to the concept of quality control. Quality control is a process that applies to all sorts of goods and services. Whenever a product is produced or service is provided, it is important for the product or service to be of good quality. This concept applies to websites just as it applies to other products. Quality control can involve very detailed and sophisticated analyses of the process by which websites are produced, but it can also be a relatively simple process of simply testing the quality of the website you've created. Websites can be tested using automated tools that validate websites or check them for errors, or they can be manually tested by observing actual users interacting with the site. This unit will explore both.</p>
