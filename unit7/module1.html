<h1>Module 1: Web Authoring Software</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this module students are introduced to web authoring software. Programs in this category allow users to
  create websites using a familiar word processor-like interface, by typing text
  and formatting it using buttons, menus, and dialog boxes. So far in this course,
  students have created web pages entirely by hand coding them in HTML. This
  process is essential to learning web design, as HTML coding gives web authors
  greater control over the website than is possible with web authoring tools. 
  A solid HTML foundation is particularly critical for advanced students 
  as they progress into web scripting and programming. Understanding
  the HTML behind the scenes, and being able to manipulate it, continues to be
  an important skill for web designers, despite the availability of software
  tools that simplify the overall task of designing a website.</p>
  
<p>This module follows the same sequence as this curriculum as a whole. Content and structure comes first (in Lesson 1), followed by presentation (in Lesson 2).</p> 
  
<p>Web authoring software allows you to create web pages using a familiar word-processor like interface. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg. One of the benefits of web authoring software is the array of features that is now available to support all aspects of website design, development, and management. Web authors can check for broken links, clean up HTML, and check for accessibility errors sitewide, to mention only a few of the features. Students will learn about and explore some of these features in Lesson 3.</p>


<h2>Lesson 1: Basic Features of Web Authoring Software</h2>
  
<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 30 - 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit7/module1/lesson1.html">Link to student Lesson 1 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
 <li>We recommend using a projector to demonstrate features of web authoring software before turning students loose to play on their own.</li>
 	<li>In this lesson students are asked to make a copy of their existing website and make changes to that copy using their web authoring software. The logistics of opening and saving and/or publishing web pages varies across school computing and networking environments. You may need to provide supplemental instruction to students on how to do this.</li>
	<li>Some web authoring tools are notorious for taking liberties with existing code. This is why it is important that students work with a copy for the current unit. When finished, the file they worked with in this lesson, <span class="filename">tools.html</span>, can be copied back into their final portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Output</h3>
	<p>When this lesson is complete, students will have added content to their <a href="../examples/unit7/module1/lesson1/index.html">tools.html</a> file.</p>


<h2>Lesson 2: Content, Structure, Presentation, and Behavior</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 30 - 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit7/module1/lesson2.html">Link to student Lesson 2 page</a>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>As with the previous lesson, this lesson works well if the instructor first provides a live demonstration of the relevant features, then turns students loose to replicate what has been demonstrated, plus explore freely on their own.</li>
  <li>Take this opportunity to review previous lessons on CSS. Which CSS properties did you use to format text? Which CSS properties were used to divide a web page into two columns? Which CSS properties did you use to format an unordered list as a navigational menu? Try to replicate some of these same activities using web authoring software. 
  </li>
  <li>Web authoring tools vary in their support for <em>creating</em> pages that use CSS for presentation. There is even more variety in their support for <em>displaying</em> CSS-based pages accurately. Remind students that what they see in the web authoring tool's &quot;design view&quot; is not necessarily what the page will look like in a web browsers. Because of this, students should regularly check their page in a browser to observe the effects of any changes they're making.</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Lesson 3: Overview of Site Management Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="timeEstimate">Estimated time required: 30 - 60 minutes</li>
  <li><a href="../../student/unit7/module1/lesson3.html">Link to student Lesson 3 page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>As with the previous lesson, this lesson works well if the instructor first provides a live demonstration of the relevant features, then turns students loose to replicate what has been demonstrated, plus explore freely on their own.</li>
