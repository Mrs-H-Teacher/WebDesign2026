<h1>Unit 7: Website Management and Authoring Tools</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Web authoring software is introduced late in this course, so that students become proficient in code without relying on these tools. Again, this curriculum is written in a vender neutral manner, so the instruction is fairly general and simply describes features that are common to most if not all web authoring products. By now you presumably will have selected a specific product in order to provide hands-on experience to students, but if not several products are listed under the heading <em>GUI Web Authoring Software</em> on the <a href="../requirements.html">Software and Hardware Requirements</a> page. To prepare for this unit, you will need to familiarize yourself with how the tasks in this unit can be performed on your particular software.
	</p>
	<p>If students pursue a career in web design or development, they are not likely to be coding by hand, but will almost certainly be using various web authoring software applications. It's important therefore for students to be exposed to these tools and to have an opportunity to play with them, but if you are running short of time, this module could be scaled back in order for students to have time to proceed with Unit 8, their client website.
