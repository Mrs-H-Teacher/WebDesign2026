<h1>Module 2: Publishing on the Web</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This module serves to wrap up the curriculum, and provide a big picture overview of how the Web works. Now that students have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have created their own portfolio website, they might be wondering how this relates to the Web they know and use every day. This may have been answered to some extent throughout the course, but this module provides a more formal opportunity to explore and discuss today's Web. This can be an especially fruitful discussion for students who might be considering whether to pursue additional education or careers in a Web-related area.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
 <li>This lesson lends itself to an email homework assignment. After students send responses to Activities 4 and 5, you can share some of the responses to spark discussion and then have the class vote on the best service provider.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lesson 2: Website Publishing Tools</h2>
  
<ul>
  <li>Estimated lesson length: 90 minutes</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Delivering This Lesson</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>Depending on student interest, one of the most important sections of this lesson might be the section with heading <em>Implications for Careers in Web Design and Development</em>. If students are contemplating additional education or even careers in web design or development, this lesson provides an opportunity to discuss the possibilities. A growing number of software applications today are delivered over the Web, and there is still a wealth of opportunity for employment for people who have Web design and development skills.</li>
	<li>The Activities section at the end of this lesson has several questions about areas to extend learning in web development. Encourage your students to incorporate their responses to these questions in their Reflection for this unit.
